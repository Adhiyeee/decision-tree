# Decision Tree

This repository contains my implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** as part of my Machine Learning learning journey.  
It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implemented using **scikit-learn**.
- Dataset: [Iris dataset ].
- Covers:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Train-test split
  - Model training
  - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - Visualization of the Decision Tree

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `decision_tree.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.
- `decision_tree_diagram.png` → Visualization of the trained Decision Tree (exported from notebook).
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies to run the notebook.
- `data/` → Dataset files (only if required).
